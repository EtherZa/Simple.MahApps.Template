Simple.MahApps.Template
=======================

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/l0e5oai0xdn7o4cc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-mahapps-template)

As with all my 'important' stuff it builds using the amazing [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oriches/simple-mahapps-template).

The app is skinned using [Mah Apps](http://mahapps.com/).

This is my example of templated WPF application using the MahApps control library to give a modern looking UI.

Okay this is *opinionated software* on the way to build a modern UI in WPF using MVVM as the MVC architecture and being 'pure' anout the separation between the View & the View Model, there are no UI concerns (colours, width's, control persistence) in the View Models. If don't agree in full separation between the View & the View Model then you might as well stop there :)
